# Ansiterra: Unifying Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management with Ansible and Terraform

##  Overview

In modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management tools are indispensable for scalable, secure, and repeatable infrastructure deployment.
While **Terraform** is widely regarded for provisioning infrastructure resources efficiently, **Ansible** has long been the leader in configuration management, orchestration, and automation.

The **Ansiterra** project demonstrates how combining these two tools can create a **unified automation framework** — using **Ansible** not only as a configuration manager but also as a **controller for Terraform modules**.
This approach simplifies workflows, strengthens consistency, and bridges the gap between **cloud infrastructure provisioning** and **on-premises configuration**.

---

##  Purpose

**Ansiterra** showcases a real-world approach where:
- **Ansible** executes and manages **Terraform modules** for AWS resource creation.
- The same **Ansible playbook** captures Terraform outputs (such as VPC IDs, Subnet CIDRs, and private IPs).
- These outputs are then used to configure **on-premises data center hosts (Host1, Host2, etc.)** — ensuring full synchronization between cloud and local environments.

This hybrid automation strategy reduces operational overhead and promotes a **single orchestration layer** for both infrastructure and configuration management.

---

##  Architecture Flow

1. **Ansible Playbook Initiates Terraform**
   - Using the `community.general.terraform` Ansible module, the playbook calls Terraform.
   - Terraform provisions AWS resources (VPC, Subnets, EC2 instances, etc.).

2. **Capture Terraform Outputs**
   - Terraform returns key infrastructure details (VPC ID, Subnet CIDR, instance IPs).
   - Ansible registers these outputs as variables.

3. **Propagate Configurations**
   - Ansible uses Jinja2 templates to generate configuration files dynamically.
   - These configuration files are distributed to **local data center servers** (`host1`, `host2`, etc.) using Ansible inventory and file modules.

4. **Unified Workflow**
   - The entire process (provisioning + configuration) runs in a **single Ansible execution flow** — simplifying automation and governance.

##  Tools & Technologies

| Tool / Platform | Role | Description |
|-----------------|------|-------------|
| **Ansible** | Orchestration & Configuration Management | Controls the workflow, executes Terraform, and applies configurations. |
| **Terraform** | Infrastructure Provisioning | Manages AWS resources declaratively with state management. |
| **AWS Cloud** | Cloud Platform | Hosts infrastructure (VPC, EC2, Subnets, Route Tables). |
| **Local Datacenter Hosts** | Hybrid Integration | Receives generated configurations based on Terraform outputs. |

---

##  Execution Example

Run the main Ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook do_terra_vpc.yml
````

This performs:

1. Terraform initialization and resource provisioning in AWS.
2. Retrieval and registration of Terraform outputs as Ansible variables.
3. Dynamic file generation and distribution to on-premises or LAN hosts.

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash

├── main.tf
├── README.md
├── var_dwc_vpc.yml

```

**Highlights:**

* The `do_terra_vpc.yml` playbook wraps Terraform execution and manages outputs.
* The `config.j2` template defines dynamic configuration files. (future refrence for version2)
* The Terraform directory holds modular IaC definitions for AWS components.

---

##  Key Benefits

**Unified Automation Pipeline** — Manage provisioning and configuration through a single control plane (Ansible).
**Multi-Tool Integration** — Leverage Terraform’s declarative provisioning and Ansible’s orchestration power together.
**Hybrid Readiness** — Extend automation from cloud to on-prem hosts.
**Modular & Scalable** — Add more Terraform modules or Ansible roles easily.
**Consistent Operations** — Reduce manual configuration drift and operational friction.

---

##  Use Case Scenarios

* **Hybrid Cloud Environments:** Synchronize AWS and on-premises network configurations.
* **Infrastructure-Driven Configuration:** Automatically generate host configurations from Terraform state.
* **Multi-Tool DevOps Workflows:** Bridge provisioning (Terraform) with post-deployment automation (Ansible).
* **Regulated Environments (Finance, KSA, BFSI):** Maintain compliance through unified state and configuration management.

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Extend to **multi-region AWS** deployments with cross-region replication.
* Create **AWS RDS MySQL DB** and  configure connection configuration in local datacenter and other **Cloud OCI, Azure IOTs**
* Integrate **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management.
* Add **Azure** and **OCI** modules for true multi-cloud support.
* Implement **auto-remediation playbooks** for configuration drift detection.
* Enhance CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

##  Architectural Insight

Terraform is excellent at defining “what” the infrastructure should look like, but Ansible excels at defining “how” the system should behave once it exists.
By combining them:

* Terraform **builds** the environment.
* Ansible **breathes life** into it.

This fusion provides full lifecycle control — from provisioning to operationalization.
